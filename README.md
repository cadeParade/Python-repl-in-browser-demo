Code taken straight from the Skulpt homepage: http://www.skulpt.org/

Nice things to add:
syntax highlighting
Better error handling

Another note:
since this is a JS implementation of Python, while loops or other things that crash computer will happen only on the student's browser. I typed an infinite while loop in and Chrome was smart enough to recognize it and stopped it for me.
